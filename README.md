# Machine-Learning-for-Option-Pricing

## Using Regression and Classification Models

## Project Overview
This project involves using machine learning models to predict the values of European call options based on various features of the options. Models tested include: 
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistics Regression 
3. KNN
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. XGBoost.

## Models
- Regression Models: Aimed to predict the actual value of options.
- Classification Models: Predicted whether the option value predictions were over or under the actual values.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of simulated European call options with features like current asset value, strike price, and time to maturity.

## Results
The models were evaluated based on their out-of-sample R squared and RMSE for regression tasks, and classification error and confusion matrix for classification tasks.
